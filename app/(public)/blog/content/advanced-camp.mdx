# Advanced Camp

Every semester, top performers of previous semester's TakeOff are called in for viva. The selected participants are invited to a months-long camp that includes classes from teachers, seniors and alumnus of ACM, long or individual contests, discussion sessions, and more. The camp is supposed to provide you with the basic to intermediate level knowledge of problem solving. This is also where you get to meet and interact with the whole community.

## Syllabus:

You can check out last semester's Advanced Camp syllabus from here: [[LINK]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mPASyOyQc9B24W_CtOmyeWaStFkxrp71H-WbnUgfJ-k/edit?usp=sharing)
