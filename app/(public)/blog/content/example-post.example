Welcome to the world of competitive programming! This guide will help you get started with the essential concepts and practices.

## What is Competitive Programming?

Competitive programming is a mind sport where participants solve well-defined computational problems within a limited time frame.

### Code Examples

Here's a simple example of solving a problem in C++:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        vector<int> a(n);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }
        // Solution logic here
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Mathematical Formulas

In competitive programming, you'll often need to work with mathematical formulas. Here's the binomial coefficient formula:

$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$

For prime numbers, we use the Sieve of Eratosthenes:

$P(n) = \{p \leq n : p \text{ is prime}\}$

### Important Notes

> Always remember to handle edge cases in your solutions. They are often the key to solving problems correctly.

## Practice Resources

1. Codeforces
2. AtCoder
3. LeetCode
4. SPOJ

### Sample Table

| Platform | Difficulty | Focus Area |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Codeforces | Medium-Hard | Algorithm Implementation |
| LeetCode | Easy-Hard | Data Structures |
| AtCoder | Medium | Mathematical Problems |

## Conclusion

Remember that competitive programming is a journey. Keep practicing and learning from each problem you solve.
