# Green Sheet Practice Tracker

Green sheet is a practice tracker consisting of beginner level competititve programming and coding problems. The sheet has a few sections, covering the basic concepts of a programming language and is really helpful for those who want to master a language or get into competitive programming. The sheet considered to be your entry into the problem-solving world.

## Sheet Link

Check out the sheet by clicking here: [LINK](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1TqavRYZeSarIO7-5r0Bi73Ne7EfmzkhMwJLGwa-5Bs8/edit)

## Rules for Maintaining the Sheet:

- You are supposed to copy the sheet to your drive and maintain it. Go to "File" and you should find the "Make a copy" option. Please do not ask for edit access.
- After solving a problem, write "OK" to the status column. The percentage and overall solve count will update automatically.
- Be honest and don't write "OK" if you haven't solved the problem.

After solving at least 60% from each section, you will get an "Eligible" mark. This makes you eligible for ["Blue Sheet"](/blog/blue-sheet) viva.

Green sheet is rather important as it is assumed that you have your basics cleared if you are marked "Eligible" in the sheet. This also makes you eligible for Blue Sheet viva, help you prepare for [TakeOff](/blog/take-off-programming-contest), [Advanced Camp](/blog/advanced-camp) viva & more.
