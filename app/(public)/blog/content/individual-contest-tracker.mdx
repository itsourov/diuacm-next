# Individual Contest Tracker

## What Does Rated Mean?

In online contest platforms (like Codeforces) there's a rating system, the more your rating is, the better (of course). If a contest is "Rated" it means your performance in that contest will affect your rating. For example, in a AtCoder contest, if you register as "Unrated" then however you perform, your rating will remain the same, but if you register as "Rated" your rating will go up or down based on your performance.

## Individual Contest Tracker

In DIU ACM, there is a contest tracker named "Individual Contest Tracker". It tracks your performance in Onsite Individual Contests, Codeforces, AtCoder and CodeChef (learn more about regular programming contests at DIU from [here](https://www.diuacm.com/blog/regular-contests)).

The links to the tracker is attached below:

- [Individual Contest Tracker (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1q1ol7O5-zHb4jLCbBOOAV0Q1aw151M7zfOWt4lp1xbY/edit)
- [Individual Contest Tracker (DIU ACM Website Version)](/trackers/individual-contest-tracker/1)

As you can notice in the Google Sheet, everyone has a column that tracks your attendance in every contests. If a contests is posted as rated on DIU ACM then "performance points" will be added to your column according to your performance in that contest. If you are absent, no points are added. You can also gain points by upsolving problems at a later time.

The Google Sheet version of the tracker has a collections of tabs for each years tracker distinctly. The sheet also contains previous trainer class resources & contests, along with previous and current programmers information.

The Tracker Sheet is rather important as it is necessarily a ranking of all competitive programmers of DIU. Your rank here affects the Team Selection process.

To get your column at the Google sheet you have to contact the current manager of the sheet. The website version on the other hand, tracks anyone who is registered in the site.
