# Blue Sheet

The **Blue Sheet** is a critical part of the **DIU ACM** ecosystem. It is designed to challenge and develop the skills of programmers who have already mastered the fundamentals through the **Green Sheet**. The Blue Sheet consists of a curated list of 1000+ problems, focusing on advanced problem-solving techniques that are essential for competitive programming success.

## Blue Sheet Viva:

- Every semster or two, there will be anouncement for new Blue sheet release.
- To be eligible to apply for viva you need to complete 60% from all sections of Green Sheet.

### How It Works:

- Every Blue Sheet has a **cut-off**. Solvers are expected to complete a certain number of problems within a set timeframe.
- If a solver cannot meet the cut-off, they are removed from the sheet.
- **New problems** are regularly added based on the performance of the top solvers.

The **Blue Sheet** plays a pivotal role in **team selection** for national and international programming contests. Solvers who consistently perform well on the Blue Sheet are recognized as the regular programmers of **DIU ACM**.
