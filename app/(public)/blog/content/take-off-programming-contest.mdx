![TakeOff Programming Contest](/images/blog/topc/topc-spring-24-main.jpg)

The TakeOff Programming Contest (TOPC) is one of the largest and most anticipated events held every semester at Daffodil International University (DIU). Organized by the DIU Computer & Programming Club (CPC) in collaboration with the Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) department, this event serves as a launchpad for students interested in the world of competitive programming.

DIU ACM, being one of the four wings of CPC & also being the one to contribute to its competitive programming aspect, plays the key role in this event. The event is supposed to be your starting point with DIU ACM & competitive programming.

## Participants:

Students enrolled in the "Programming & Problem Solving" course (generally 1st semester) can participate in the contest.

## Contests:

There are a total of 3 contests.

1. **Mock Round:** The Mock Round is supposed to make you familiar with the contest platform (generally [Toph](https://toph.co)) and other rules. It usually takes place online the night before the Preliminary Round. The round is generally open for all, meaning everyone accessing the contest platform can particpate in the round. Your performance here does not affect anything.
2. **Preliminary Round:** Preliminary Rounds affects your selection for the Main Round. It may sometimes be divided into 2 or more slots, depending on the number of participants. The contest is around 2 to 3 hours long, you are given around 7 problems and you can submit the solutions using C, C++, Python or any of your preferred programming languages.
3. **Main Round:** You will get selected for Main based on your performance in the Preliminary round. Historically, around 250 contestants are selected. You are given around 10 problems and around 3 hours to solve them. The contest environment is very similar to the Preliminary Rounds.

## Problem Set:

There are usually 7-10 problems for each round. Problem set for the rounds are prepared by teachers, current top programmers of DIU ACM & alumnus. TakeOff problem set mostly consists of beginner level problems, covering the basics of programming languages like I/O, conditional statements, loops, control statements, data structures etc. It tests your logic building capabilities and implementation skills. You can check out previous TakeOff problem sets from [Toph](https://toph.co) to get a clear idea.

## Contest Rules:

- You are not allowed to bring any kind of electronic devices to the contest room.
- You cannot bring soft-copy templates. You can bring hard-copy templates, cheat sheets and books.
- You are not allowed to use any other sites other than contest platform.

## Aftermath:

Every semester, top performer of the previous semester's TakeOff are called in for a via for [Advanced Programming Camp](/blog/advanced-camp). This is where you start to get into our CP community and grow yourselft as a competitive programmer.

Like any other programming contests, there are t-shirts, food, balloons, flags and exciting prizes for the contestants.
